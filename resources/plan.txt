STEP 1  Gather Data (Images only)
    Seatbelt (on / off)
    Phone usage (using phone / safe)
    Drowsiness (eyes open / closed, yawn)

STEP 2 Organize Data
    Split images into:
        train (80%)
        val (20%)

dataset/
 ├─ seatbelt/
 │   ├─ train/
 │   └─ val/
 ├─ phone/
 │   ├─ train/
 │   └─ val/
 └─ drowsiness/
     ├─ train/
     └─ val/


STEP 3 Train Small CNN Models:
    Train one CNN per task:
        Seatbelt CNN
        Phone CNN
        Drowsiness CNN

STEP 4 Test Models on Images
    Check:
    Accuracy
    Wrong predictions

    Improve by:
    Adding more images
    Balancing classes

STEP 5 Real-Time Camera Detection

Use OpenCV to:
    Open webcam
        Capture frames
    Pass frames to models
    Get predictions

STEP 6 Decision Logic

Simple rules:

If seatbelt off → warning

If phone detected → warning

If eyes closed for long → drowsy alert


STEP 7 Show Alerts

Display text on screen:

“Wear seatbelt”

“Do not use phone”

“Drowsy driver detected”
